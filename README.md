Development: Main development completed with intermittent improvements

## Description

This is a terminal based game written in Go, which is inspired by terminal hacking in Fallout 3. In this game, a 2d grid is filled with single 'dud' characters and words. The objective is to determine which word is the winning word in a limited number of guesses. Each incorrect guess will tell you how many of the selected letters are correct. A letter is correct if it has the same index and actual character as in the winning word. For example. if the winning word is `book` and selected word is `bang`, the selected word has one correct character.

Running this inside of `cool-retro-term` is suggested because it looks sick. Just search `cool-retro-term` on github, download the latest relase, build this from source, then run this in the new terminal.

Below is a run in `cool-retro-term`:

## Design

This game is created with a very low-level drawing library called Termbox. Because of this, I had to program all navigation/animation functionaliy.
